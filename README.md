# Freeflow 

**FreeFlow** is a Traffic light system that uses AI technology to control traffic lights and lowers traffic congestion.

# **Introduction**
With an increasing population and automobiles in cities, urban traffic congestion is becoming one of the most pressing issues. In addition to prolonging travel times and adding stress to drivers, traffic congestion also use more fuel and increase carbon dioxide air pollution. The traffic lights is one of critical elements affecting the traffic flow. Instead of being traffic-dependent, the typical traffic patterns depend on time. In this project, a traffic control system based on image processing and python code is proposed, which alters the timing of green, yellow, and red lights depending on the volume of traffic.
